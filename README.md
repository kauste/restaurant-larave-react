# Moon mining project 'HELIUM 3'

This is a Laravel React project made for educational purposes only. The main goal was to learn the connection between Laravel and React.
I have plans to do all the CRUD for this project in the future.

## Used for the first time

- Breeze
- Inertia
- Read (from CRUD) on react
- Sort, filter, search on react

## Deepen my knowledge

- CRUD
- Faker
